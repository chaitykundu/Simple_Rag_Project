What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a type of machine learning that teaches computers to perform tasks by learning from examples, much like humans do. 
Imagine teaching a computer to recognize cats: instead of telling it to look for whiskers, ears, and a tail, you show it thousands of pictures of cats. 
The computer finds the common patterns all by itself and learns how to identify a cat. This is the essence of deep learning.

In technical terms, deep learning uses something called "neural networks," which are inspired by the human brain. These networks consist of layers of 
interconnected nodes that process information. The more layers, the "deeper" the network, allowing it to learn more complex features and perform more sophisticated tasks.
