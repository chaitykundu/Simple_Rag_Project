It uses non -\\nionizing electromagnetic radiation and appears to \\nbe without exposure -related hazard. It employs \\nradio frequency (RF) radiation in the presence of \\ncarefully controlled magnetic fields in order to  \\nproduce high quality cross -sectional images of \\nthe body in any plane. The MR Image is \\nconstructed by placing the patient inside a large \\nmagnet, which induces a relatively strong \\nExternal magnetic field. This causes the nuclei of \\nmany atoms in the body, in cluding Hydrogen, to \\nalign them with the magnetic field and later \\napplication of RF signal, Energy is released from \\nthe body, detected and used to construct the MR \\nimage by C omputer.(1)  Table 1 shows the brief \\nhistory of the MRI development. \\nBasic MR Physics \\nAtomic Structure : The nucleus of an atom \\nconsists of two particles;  \\n1.

This is because, as spin is associated \\nwith an electrical char ge, a magnetic field is \\ngenerated in nuclei with impaired nucleons, \\ncausing these nuclei to act as magnets with North \\nand South poles (magnetic dipoles) .(6)  \\nImportance of hydrogen nucleons in MRI \\nIt is the major species that is MR \\nsensitive and most abundant atom in the body in \\nthe form of water (H 2O). For the hydrogen \\nnucleons which consist of a solitary, unpaired \\nproton acts as a magnetic dipole. These magnetic \\ndipoles, in the abs ence of external influence, are \\nrandomly oriented and as such have zero net \\nMagnetization.(6) When an external magnetic \\nfield is applied to this sample, all the hydrogen \\nnuclear axes true up in the direction of the \\nmagnetic field, producing a quantity of net \\nmagnetization, and this can result in of 2 ways \\neither in the direction of the filed i.e., which \\nparallel the external magnetic field – spin up, or \\nalign anti -parallel (opposite) with t he magnetic \\nfield, spin down. These orientations correspond \\nto lower energy state and highly energy states of \\nthe dipole respectively . Nuclei can be made to \\nundergo transition from one energy state to \\nanother by absorbing or releasing certain \\nquantity of e nergy. This energy can be supplied \\nor recovered in the form of electromagnetic \\nenergy in RF portion of the electromagnetic \\nspectrum and this transition from one energy \\nlevel to another is called resonance. (10) \\nWhen an external magnetic field is \\napplied, their N and S poles d o not align exactly \\nwith the direction of the magnetic field .The axes \\nof spinning protons oscillate or wobble with a \\nslight tilt from a position which was parallel with \\nthe flux of external magnet. This tilting or \\nwobbling is called precession . The rate or  \\nfrequency of precession is called the Resonant or \\nLarmor frequency, which is proportional to the \\nstrength of t he applied magnetic field. The \\nLarmor frequency of hydrogen is 42.58 MHZ in \\na magnetic field of 1 Tesla, where one Tesla is \\n10,000 times the eart h‟s magnetic field. The \\nmagnetic field strengths used for MR imaging \\nrange from 0.1 to 4.0T.(10)  \\nLarmor equation is expressed as      \\nF = r B \\nWhere F is the resonant frequency, r is the gyro \\nmagnetic ratio and B is the applied filed.  \\nIn summary, when nuclei are subjected \\nto the flux of an external magnetic field, tw o \\nenergy states result. Spin -up: which is in the \\ndirection of the field  and spin -down: This is in \\nthe opposite direction of the field.  The combined \\neffect of these two energy states is a weak net \\nmagnetic moment, or magnetization vector (MV) \\nParallel with the applied magnetic field . When \\nenergy in the form of all electromagnetic wave \\nfrom a RF antenna coil is directed tissue with \\nprotons (hydrogen nuclei) that are aligned in the \\nZ axis by an external static magnetic field (by the \\nimaging magnet), the pro tons in the tissue that \\nhave a L armor frequency matching that of \\nelectromagnetic wave absorb energy and shift or \\nrotate away from the direction induced by the \\nimaging magnet.  \\n  If longer the RF pulse is applied, the  \\ngreater the angle of rotation. If pulse is of \\nsufficient intensity (duration), it will rotate the \\nnet tissue magnetization vector into a transverse \\nplane (XY plane), which is perpendicular to \\nlongitudinal alignment (Z-Axis) and cause all the \\nprotons to pr ecess in phase, this is referred to as \\na 90 0 RF pulse or a flip angle of 90 0. At this \\nprecise moment, a maximal RF signal is induced \\nin a receiver coil. This signal depends on the \\npresence or absence of hydrogen and also all the \\ndegree to which hydrogen is  bound within a \\nmolecule. Eg: Bone – due to presence of tightly \\nbound hydrogen atoms, they do not align \\nthemselves with external magnetic field and do \\nnot produce a usable signal.      \\nIn soft tissues and liquids – due to \\npresence of loosely bound or mobile hydrogen \\natoms, tilt and align to produce detectable signal. \\nThe measure of the concentration of loosely \\nbound hydrogen nuclei available to create the \\nsignal is referred to as proton density or spin \\ndensity of the tissue in question .(10) When the \\nradio waves (RF pulse)  are turned off, 2 events \\noccur simultaneously  \\n\\uf0b7 The radiation of energy and the return of nuclei \\nto their original spin state at a lower energy. This \\nprocess is called relaxation and the energy loss is \\ndetected as a signal, which is called free \\ninduction decay (FID).  \\n\\uf0b7 First, the nuclei in transverse alignment begin to \\nrealign themselves with the main magnetic field \\nand net magnetization regions to the original \\nlongitudinal orientation. This relation is \\naccomplished by a transfer of energy from \\nindividual hy drogen nuclei (spin) to the \\nsurrounding molecules (Lattice).'),\n",

Because T 1 is all \\nexponential growth time constant, a tissue with \\nshort T 1 produces all intense MR signal and is \\ndisplayed as bright white in a T1 weighted image. \\nA tissue with long T 1 produces a – low intensity \\nsignal and appears dark in MR image . Second, \\nthe magne tic moments of adjacent hydrogen \\nnuclei begin to interfere with one another; this \\ncauses the nuclei to diphase, with a resultant loss \\nof transverse magnetization .(10) The time \\nconstant that describes the rate of loss of \\ntransverse magnetization is called  T2 relaxation \\ntime / transverse (Spin) relaxation time. The \\ntransverse magnetization rapidly decays \\n(exponentially) to zero, as do the amplitude and \\nduration of the detected radio signal. A T 2-\\nweighted image is acquired using a long \\nrepetition tine between RF pulses and a long  \\nsignal recovery time. A tissue with a long T 2 \\nproduces a high -intensity signal and is bright in \\nthe image. One with short T 2 produces a low -\\nintensity signal and is dark in the image.(6)   \\n     Image contrast among the various \\ntissues in the body is manipulated in MRI by \\nvarying the rate at which the RF pulse is \\ntransmitted A short repetition tine (TR) of \\n500msec between pulses and a short echo of \\nsignal recovery tine (TE) of 20msec produce s T1 \\nweighted image. A long TR (2000msec) and a \\nlong TE (80msec) produces T 2 weighted images \\nfor every diagnostic task, the operator must \\ndecide which imaging sequence will being out \\noptimal image contrast. (10) T1 weighted images \\nare called fat images because the fat ha s the \\nshortest T1 relaxation tine and the lightest signal \\nrelative to other tissues and thus appear bright in \\nthe image. High anatomic detail is possible in \\nthis type of image because of good image \\ncontrast. T 1 weighted images are thus useful or \\ndepicting small anatomic regions (eg: TMJ) \\nwhere high spatial resolution is required.(10)  \\nT2 Weighted images are called water \\nimages because water has the longest T 2 \\nrelaxation tine and thus appear bright in the \\nimage. In general, the T 2 time of abnormal \\ntissues is longer than that of  normal tissues. \\nImages with T 2 weighting are most commonly \\nused when the practitioner is looking for \\ninflammatory changes and tumors. \\nT1 Weighted images are more \\ncommonly used to demonstrate anatomy. In \\npractice, images often must be acquired with \\nboth T1 and T2 weighting to separate the several \\ntissues by contrast resolution. Localization of \\nMRI to specific part of the body (selecting a \\nslice) and the ability to create a 3 dimensional \\nimage depends on the fact that the larmor \\nfrequency of a nucleus is gov erned in part by the \\nstrength of the external magnetic field.  \\nThe magnetic gradient is produced by \\nthree electromagnetic coils within the bore of \\nimaging magnet. The coils surround the patient \\nand produce magnetic field that oppose and \\nredirect the magnet ic flux in 3 orthogonal or \\nright angle directions to delineate individual \\nvolumes of tissues (vowels), which are subjected \\nto magnetic fields of unique strength. \\nPartitioning the local magnetic fields lines all the \\nhydrogen protons, in particular voxel to the same \\nresonant frequency. This is called selective \\nexcitation, when a RF pulse with a range of \\nfrequencies is applied, a voxel of tissue tuned to \\none of the frequencies is excited, when the RF \\nradiation is terminated, the excited voxel radiates \\nthat dis tinctive frequency, identifying and \\nlocalizing it. The band width or spectrum of \\nfrequencies of the RF pulse and the magnitude of \\nslice selecting gradient determine the slice \\nthickness. (10) Slice thickness can be reduced by \\nincreasing the gradient strength or decreasing the \\nRF band width (frequency range) . How does a \\npatient attain the results of the MRI scan?

The latter refers to the sampled signal \\nbeing in the wonderful world of K-Space. \\nThe steps involved in the production of an \\nMRI study may be summarized as follows(1): \\n1. A powerful, uniform, external magnetic field is \\nemployed to align the normally randomly \\noriented water contained in the t issue being \\nexamined. \\n2. This alignment (or magnetization) is next \\nperturbed or disrupted by introduction of external \\nRF energy at an appropriate frequency so as to \\ninduce resonance. Spatial localization is obtained \\nthrough application of a spatially dependen t \\nmagnetic field (referred to as a gradient) during \\nthe same time that RF energy is introduced into \\nthe tissue. The gradient field selectively \\nmodulates the resonant frequency of the patient \\nin accordance to the larmor equation. \\n3. The nuclei return to their restive alignment \\nthrough various relaxation processes and in so \\ndoing emit RF energy proportional to the \\nmagnitude of their initial alignment or \\nmagnetization. \\n4. After an appropriate period following initial RF \\ndeposition, the emitted signals are measured o r \\nread out. \\n5. A mathematical process called Fourier \\ntransformation is used to convert the frequency \\nformation contained in the signal from each \\nlocation in the imaged plane to corresponding \\nintensity levels, which are then displayed as \\nshades of gray in a ma trix arrangement of, for \\nexample, 256 X 256 pixels. \\n6. Protons in the various tissues in the imaged slice \\nrealign with the magnetic field at different rates, \\nso that at any given moment there is difference in \\nsignal strength between various tissues. This \\ndifference in signal strength from region to \\nregion constitutes the basis of tissue contrast and \\nforms the substrate for interpretation of the \\nimage. \\nAdvantages of MRI(6) \\n1. No Ionizing Radiation: RF pulses used in MRI do \\nnot cause ionization and have no harmful effects \\nof ionizing radiation. Hence can be used in child \\nbearing ladies and children. \\n2. Non-invasive: MRI is non-invasive. \\n3. Contrast resolution: It is the Principle advantage \\nof MRI,  i.e. ability of an image process to \\ndistinguish adjacent soft tissue from one another.  \\nIt can manipulate the contrast between different \\ntissues by altering the pattern of RF pulses. \\n4. Multiplanar image: With MRI , we can obtain \\ndirect, sagittal, coronal and obliqu e image which \\nis impossible with radiography and CT. \\n5. It could differentiate between acute and chronic \\ntransit and fibrous phases parallel with \\nhistopathological changes. \\n6. Absence of significant artifact associated with \\ndental filling. \\n7. No adverse effect has yet been demonstrated. \\n8. Image manipulation can be done. \\n9. Useful in determining intramedullary spread.  \\nDisadvantages of MRI(6) \\n1. Claustrophobia i.e. morbid fear of closed places \\nbecause the patient is within the large magnet up \\nto one hour. \\n2.  MRI equipment is expensive to purchase, \\nmaintain, and operate. Hardware and software are \\nstill being developed. \\n3. Because of the strong magnetic field used in \\npatient electrically, magnetically or mechanically \\nactivated implants such as cardiac pacemakers, \\nimplantable defibrillators and some artificial \\nheart valves may not be able to have MRI safely. \\n4. The MRI image bec omes distorted by metal, so \\nthe image is distorted in patients with surgical \\nclips or stents, for instance. \\n5. Bone does not give MR signal, a signal is \\nobtained only from the bone marrow . Long \\nscanning time and requires patient‟s co-operation. \\n6.  The very powe rful magnets can pose problems \\nwith sitting of equipment although shielding is \\nnow becoming more sophisticated. \\n7. MRI scanners are noisy. \\n8. Patient could develop an allergic reaction \\nto the contrasting agent, or that a skin \\ninfection could develop at the site of \\ninjection. \\n9. MRI cannot always distinguish between \\nmalignant tumors or benign disease, which could \\nlead to a false positive result. \\n10. Facilities are not widely available, but with the \\ndevelopment of small open systems suitable for \\ndistrict general hospitals.  \\n11. Bone, teeth, air and metallic objects all appear \\nblack, making differentiation     difficult. \\nCharacteristic Normal MR Appearance of \\nOral and Maxillofacial Region: MR images are \\ncommonly acquired using Spin echo pulse \\nsequence. T1 and T2 Weighted images  are \\nobtained for examinations of oral and \\nmaxillofacial regions . T1-Weighted images are \\nused for anatomical evaluation and T2- weighted \\nimages are for the detection of pathological \\nprocesses. Both T1 and T2 - Weighted images \\nare studied for disease detect ion, extent and \\ncharacter. Images in the Coronal and Axial \\nplanes are routinely obtained for   three -\\ndimensional evaluation of disease in MR \\nexaminations. Images in the Sagittal plane are \\nsometimes added.  To understand normal MRI \\nAnatomy of Oral and Maxill ofacial regions, it is \\nnecessary to be familiar with some terms that \\nexpress MR signal intensities. \\n Signal intensity: The intensity of signal \\nfrom each tissue on MR images is termed the \\n“Signal Intensity”.(11) \\n1) Low signal intensity: If the signal intensity from \\na tissue is lower than that of muscle on T1 or T2'),\n",
